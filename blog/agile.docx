List of Methodology:
    1. Waterfall 
    2.spiral
    3.....

Waterfall:
    It is basically from starting to ending process
    1. Requirement
    2. Design
    3. Developing
    4. Testing
    5. Deploying

    This all process will happen step by step process.
    once you complete first step then only you will go to second process.

    Disadvantages:
        * You can't able to go back. it's means once completed Design part, then you 
          proceed to Deploying part. when you are in Developing new requirement should
          not come and new design changing should not come. 

spiral:
    It is looking like mosquito coil, or like spiral.
    Please refer the image to understand the process.



Basic problems of this methodologies:
    * Estimation
    * Requirement changes
    * Time management
    * Meeting without agenda
    * Miss communication with tools

    Estimation:
        This methodologies d't plan for estimation time period to close the work.
        There's only plan to complete the project by end of the time.
    Requirement changes:
        If the requirement change comes in the between time of the project mean, 
        the requirement will accepted but the closing time period of project 
        will not extend. so it's affect the process of developing.
    Time management:
        Time management is the biggest problem. Because developers put the full 
        effort in end of the project time period, not in the beginning.
        So they can't identify the project will complete the certain period or not.
    Meeting without agenda:
